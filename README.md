# Overview
As final group project in the Data Analitycs training program, we were requested to chose a finance-related topic and to use the all the following technologies: Excel, Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## ESG_vs_non_ESG_ETFs
The topic we chose was sustainable investing. This project conducts a comprehensive data analysis on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ETFs. It compares their returns and other indicators to those of comparable traditional ETFs across the following markets: US, Global ex-US, Emerging Markets and Europe. As requested, the analysis was carried out using Excel, Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## Key features
- Data Sources: Main datasets were procured from Yahoo Finance and etf.com.
- Data Management: Initial data aggregation and organization were done using MS Excel.
- Analysis Tools: Comprehensive data analysis was performed using Python (with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn), SQL, and Power BI.
- Metrics Analyzed: Our project delves deep into various performance metrics such as:
  - Cumulative return
  - Excess return
  - Standard deviation (representing risk)
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Information Ratio (both representing risk-adjusted returns)

## Key Findings
- Broadly, ESG ETFs and Non-ESG ETFs showcase similar performance in terms of long term returns.
- However, there are more difference when looking at specific markets and during different economic cycles.
